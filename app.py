- **Core and Posture**: Evaluates spinal stiffness, rotation, and squat ability to detect early degeneration or joint limitations.
- **Strength and Balance**: Tests dynamic movements like jumps and one-leg balance to assess power, control, and proprioception.
- **Recovery and Lifestyle**: Captures daily spine care, sleep posture, postural awareness, and history of chronic stress.
